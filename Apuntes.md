Function of the input size to determine how long will a program take to run.

- N = Input size
- T(N) = Time based off the input size
- a = Incognita that we need to find based off real data

$$
T(N) = a * N^3
$$

Example: The time for running the program with input size 1000 was 0.198s, so in order to get *a*, we must solve the following equation:

$$
0.198s = a * 1000^3 --> a = 198 * 10^-12
$$

And so, replacing *a* in the first equation, we can get the aproximate time for any given *N*.
